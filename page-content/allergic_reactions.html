                A person will most likely have an <b>Allergic Reaction</b> at some point in their life and are commonly referred
                as having <b>Allergies</b>. Allergic reactions ranges from mild cases such as water eyes or a runny nose to more
                life-threatening cases, in which your throat closes up. These responses to are an overreaction of the
                body&rsquo;s immune system.
            </p>
            <p>
                The immune system is your body&rsquo;s self defense system to protect the body from harmful bacterias and
                viruses by producing antibodies. An <b>Allergic Reaction</b> occurs when the body&rsquo;s immune system considers a
                typically non-threatening substance a threat and takes defensive actions against it. These substances
                are known as <b>Allergens</b>. Allergens can be anything; ranging from dust particles to cosmetics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the <b>Causes</b> of an allergic reaction are pet dander, bee stings or insects bites. Many medications
                like penicillin and aspirin are very common allergens and can be very unpredictable. Other allergens can
                be pollen, and molds. Being stung by an insect can also bring about an allergic reaction. A &#34;Bug Bite&#34;
                is actually your body reacting to the insects toxin of venom. Some people are allergic to latex, or
                rubber produces. The most common allergens are food. Food allergies can be nuts or shellfish, which can
                be quite life threatening.

                Allergic Reactions are usually broken down into three cases; Mild Cases, Severe Cases, and
                Life-Threatening Cases. <b>Mild Cases</b> are the most common allergic reactions and are the easiest to handle.
                <b>Severe Cases</b> usually need medical prescriptions and can cause the need for medical assistance.
                <b>Life-Threatening Cases</b> as the name suggests are the most dangerous cases and need to be handled
                immediately with the proper care.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="Mild_Case">
            <p>
                The <b>Symptoms of Mild Cases</b> are usually itching, nasal congestion known as rhinitis, rashes, scratchy
                throat, watery or itchy eyes and hives. <b>Hives</b> are itchy red spots on the skin. <b>DO NOT SCRATCH THE Hives</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Treatment for Mild Allergic Reactions</b> are taking Benadryl or antihistamine. If your symptoms worsen or
                do not subside after a few days see your local doctor.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="Severe_Cases">
            <p>
                <b>Severe Cases</b> have a range of different symptoms. The <b>Symptoms of a Severe Cases</b> are abdominal cramping or
                pain, tightness or pain in the chest, diarrhea, difficulty swallowing, dizziness or vertigo, fear or anxiety,
                nausea or vomiting, and flushing of the face. More serious symptoms are heart palpitations, swelling of
                the face, eyes, or tongue, feeling weak, wheezing, difficulty breathing, and unconsciousness. Severe
                and sudden allergic reactions can develop within seconds after exposure to an allergen. This is known
                as <b>anaphylaxis</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                To <b>Treat Severe Allergic Reactions</b> if the person experiencing the allergic reaction is showing some of
                the more serious symptoms such as swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue, call 911 or get the person to
                emergency facility. Also ask the person if they have an EpiPen and help them administer it if they can
                not administer it themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the person is showing some of the less serious symptoms of a Severe Allergic Reaction such as
                dizziness or diarrhea, ask the person if they are allergic to anything and remove the substance. Wait to
                see if the symptoms persist. If they do, take the person to your local doctor.
            </p>

                The Life-Threatening Cases are the most dangerous allergic reactions and should not be taken lightly.
                The <b>Symptoms for a Life-Threatening Case</b> are swelling of the airway, inability to breathe, sudden and
                severe drop in blood pressure.
            </p>
            <h5>
                IF THESE SYMPTOMS OCCUR PLEASE CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY, WITHOUT TREATMENT A
                PERSON CAN DIE WITHIN 15 MINUTES.
            </h5>
            <p>
                The first step to <b>Treat a Life-Threatening Case</b> is to call 911 or get personal medical assistance.
                Check to see if the person is breathing and provide CPR if necessary. If the person has an EpiPen help
                them administer it.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the person is unconscious, lay the person flat on their back and elevate their legs. Lastly place a
                blanket over them. This will prevent the person from going into shock.
