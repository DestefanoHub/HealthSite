                        A person will most likely have an allergic reaction at some point in their life and are commonly referred to
                        as having allergies. Allergic reactions range from mild cases such as watery eyes or a runny nose to more
                        life-threatening cases, in which your throat closes up. These responses are an overreaction of the
                        body&rsquo;s immune system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The immune system is your body&rsquo;s self defense system to protect the body from harmful bacterias and
                        viruses by producing antibodies. An allergic reaction <strong>occurs</strong> when the body&rsquo;s immune system considers a
                        typically non-threatening substance a threat and takes defensive actions against it. These substances
                        are known as allergens. Allergens can be anything; ranging from dust particles to cosmetics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some <strong>allergens</strong> are pet dander, bee stings or insects bites. Many medications
                        like penicillin and aspirin are very common allergens and can be very unpredictable. Other allergens can
                        be pollen and molds. Being stung by an insect can also bring about an allergic reaction. A &#34;bug bite&#34;
                        is actually your body reacting to the insect's venom. Some people are allergic to polymers like latex and
                        rubber. The most common allergens are food. Food allergies can be nuts or shellfish, which can
                        be quite life threatening.

                Allergic reactions are usually broken down into three cases; mild cases, severe cases, and
                life threatening cases. Mild cases are the most common allergic reactions and are the easiest to handle.
                Severe cases usually need medical prescriptions and can cause the need for medical assistance.
                Life-threatening cases are the most dangerous cases and need to be handled
                immediately with the proper care.
            </p>

                    <p>
                        The <strong>symptoms</strong> of mild cases are usually itching, nasal congestion known as rhinitis, rashes, scratchy
                        throat, watery or itchy eyes and hives. Hives are itchy red spots on the skin. DO NOT scratch the hives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Treatment</strong> for mild allergic reactions are taking Benadryl or an antihistamine. If your symptoms worsen or
                        do not subside after a few days see your local doctor.

            <p>
                Severe cases have a range of different symptoms. The <strong>symptoms </strong>of a severe cases are abdominal cramping or
                pain, tightness or pain in the chest, diarrhea, difficulty swallowing, dizziness or vertigo, fear or anxiety,
                nausea or vomiting, and flushing of the face. More serious symptoms are heart palpitations, swelling of
                the face, eyes, or tongue, feeling weak, wheezing, difficulty breathing, and unconsciousness. Severe
                and sudden allergic reactions can develop within seconds after exposure to an allergen. This is known
                as anaphylaxis.
            </p>
            <p>
                To <strong>treat</strong> severe allergic reactions if the person experiencing the allergic reaction is showing some of
                the more serious symptoms such as swelling of the face, eyes, or tongue, call 911 or get the person to an
                emergency facility. Also ask the person if they have an EpiPen and help them administer it if they can
                not administer it themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the person is showing some of the less serious symptoms of a severe allergic reaction such as
                dizziness or diarrhea, ask the person if they are allergic to anything and remove the substance. Wait to
                see if the symptoms persist. If they do, take the person to your local doctor.
            </p>

            <p>
                The life-threatening cases are the most dangerous allergic reactions and should not be taken lightly.
                The <strong>symptoms </strong>for a life-threatening case are swelling of the airway, inability to breathe, sudden and
                severe drop in blood pressure.  IF THESE SYMPTOMS OCCUR PLEASE CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY, WITHOUT TREATMENT A
                PERSON CAN DIE WITHIN 15 MINUTES.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first step to <strong>treat</strong> a life-threatening case is to call 911 or get personal medical assistance.
                Check to see if the person is breathing and provide CPR if necessary. If the person has an EpiPen help
                them administer it.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the person is unconscious, lay the person flat on their back and elevate their legs. Lastly place a
                blanket over them. This will prevent the person from going into shock.
            </p>
