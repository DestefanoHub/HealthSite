              &#34;A <b>Seizure</b> is a sudden surge of electrical activity in the brain&#34;,
              according to the <b>Epilepsy Foundation</b>, and usually lasts for a short period of time.
              This electrical activity occurs when complex chemical changes in nerve cells, in which
              ase the brain cells stop sending messages. When there is too much or too little activity
              in the brain that causes the excited brain cells, which tell the other brain cells to stop
              sending messages, and this is when electrical surge occurs; causing the seizure.

                Some seizures can be disabling while others can be hardly noticeable. There are two
                types of seizure: <b>Generalized Seizures</b> or Local Seizures, and <b>Partial Seizures</b> or
                Focal Seizures. The classification of the type of seizure helps doctors diagnose
                if a person has epilepsy or not. <b>Generalized Seizures</b> occur when electrical impulses
                are produced throughout the entire brain. <b>Partial Seizures</b> occur when electrical
                impulses are produced in a relatively small part of the brain. However as a partial
                seizure continues the affected area of the brain can increase.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="Generalized_Seizure_Symptoms">
            <p>
                There are <b>five Subcategories of Generalized Seizures</b>. The first is a <b>&#34;Grand Mal&#34;
                Seizure</b> which is also referred to as a <b>Tonic-Clonic Seizure</b>. The <b>Symptoms of a
                &#34;Grand Mal&#34; Seizure</b> are unconsciousness, convulsions, and muscle rigidity. After the person
                goes into unconsciousness the body starts <b>Jerking</b> for 30-60 seconds. Immediately after the jerking
                stops the body becomes <b>Stiff</b> for 30-60 seconds. The person then goes into a deep sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next subcategory of Generalized Seizures is an <b>Absence Seizure</b>. This seizure occurs more
                often with children. The <b>Symptom of a Absence Seizure</b> is brief loss of consciousness. The seizure
                interrupts daily activity and causes the person to stare blankly into space, which can happen multiple
                times throughout the day. The person is most likely unaware that they are even having a seizure since
                they end as abruptly as they begin. Though the person may feel like they are losing time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Myoclonic</b> is another subcategory of Generalized Seizures. The <b>Symptoms of a Myoclonic Seizure</b>
                are isolated, jerking movements on both sides of the body, which can result in the person throwing or
                dropping objects violently. The person may feel like they are being electrically shocked.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last three subcategories of a Generalized Seizure are <b>Clonic</b>, <b>Tonic</b> and <b>Atonic</b>.
                When a <b>Clonic Seizure</b> occurs the body begins jerking movements repetitively. During a <b>Tonic
                Seizure</b> the muscles become stiff and rigid. An <b>Atonic Seizure</b> makes a person loss muscle tone
                which can result in them falling.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="Partial_Seizure_Symptoms">
            <p>
                The three <b>Subcategories for Partial Seizures</b> are are Simple. Complex and Partial Seizure with Secondary
                Generalization. A <b>Simple Seizure</b> occurs when the person&rsquo;s awareness is retained. A <b>Complex Seizure</b>
                causes the impairment of a person&rsquo;s awareness. The last subcategory of Partial Seizure is <b>Partial
                Seizure with Secondary Generalization</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>Symptoms of a Simple Seizure</b> are upset stomach, racing heart, diarrhea. loss of bladder control.
                There are three types of Simple Seizures. The first is a <b>Simple Motor Seizure</b>; when this seizure
                happens a person&rsquo;s body begins jerking with spasms as the muscles goes rigid. The head also turns
                vigorously. When a <b>Simple Sensory Seizure</b> occurs, unusual sensations affect a person&rsquo;s sensors; vision,
                hearing, smell, taste, and touch, causing the sensories to not work properly. The last type of Simple
                Seizures is a <b>Simple Psychological Seizure</b>. This type of seizure causes a person to have memory or
                emotional disturbances. As well as having them have a deja-vu feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>Symptoms of a Complex Seizure</b> are automatisms; such as lip smacking, chewing, fidgeting, walking
                and other repetitive, involuntary but coordinated movements. The person may also seem to stare into
                space and feel or look as if they are &#34;out of it.&#34;
            </p>
            <p>
                A <b>Partial Seizure with Secondary Generalization</b> occurs when the symptoms that are initially associated
                with a preservation of consciousness that then evolves into a loss of consciousness and convulsions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="treatment">
            <p>
                When someone begins having a Seizure it is important to remain calm. There are two <b>Treatment</b> procedures to
                follow when a person begins to have a seizure. The two treatments: <b>While</b> the Seizure is occurring and <b>After</b>
                the Seizure.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>During a Seizure</b> you need to protect the person from other injuries, by keeping them from falling or guiding
                them to the floor. Move any furniture or objects that might harm the person. If you can place the person on
                their side so that any fluid that might form can leak out of their mouth. Don&rsquo;t apply <b>TOO</b> much pressure on
                the body and Never try to hold the person down. Please keep your fingers away from the person&rsquo;s mouth for
                they might bite you. Lastly pay attention to what the person is doing to tell your doctor later.
            </p>
            <ol>
                You need to <b>Pay Attention</b>:
                <li>How the person&rsquo;s body moved</li>
                <li>How long the seizure lasted</li>
                <li>How the person acted before the seizure</li>
                <li>How the person acted immediately after the seizure</li>
                <li>Whether the person suffered any injuries from the seizure</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                <b>After a Seizure</b> occurs you need to check the person for injuries and if the person is not on their side
                turn them on it. Check to see if the person is having trouble breathing and if they are clear the airway
                with your finger. Loosen the person&rsquo;s cloths around the neck and waist and provide safe area for the
                person to rest. Do not let the person eat or drink until they are fully alert. Please stay with the
                person until the surroundings are familiar to the person. The last step is to take the person to the
                doctor.
            </p>

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="remember">
            <p>
                Seizures are usually a symptom of other disorders, such as epilepsy. However this does not mean that they
                should be taken any less seriously. If someone is having a seizure get personal assistance immediately.
