    Pus is a whiteish or yellowish fluid produced by our bodies. Most people have experienced pus before, as it is in
    pimples. Pus may sometimes appear in wounds, but it is not necessarily a bad thing. Pus contains dead white blood
    cells, bacteria, and skin cells, but can also contain some live bacteria. Pus is a sign of an infection, but it also
    indicates that your body is fighting the infection. A small amount of pus is okay (like that in a pimple), but larger
    amounts of pus should be removed as it can become toxic. If you see pus in a wound, pay close attention to it and
    make sure you continue to thoroughly clean it. If the amount of pus increases, you should seek medical attention.
