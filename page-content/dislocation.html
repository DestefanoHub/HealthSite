				<p><strong>Definition</strong>: Dislocation is when two bones are out of place from the joints that connect them together.
				Sports and physical activity are common causes of dislocation as well as vehicular accidents and falls. 
				Dislocations are usually caused by a sudden impact to the joint. This usually occurs following a blow, fall, or other trauma. For example, if one falls on their arm, it may dislocate.
				Some people are born with looser ligaments and are more prone to dislocation.</p>
				<p><strong>Prevention</strong>: Take proper caution with sports and other physical activities. Wear appropriate protection and act responsibly. Also watch areas of friction or anything that may make you a fall.<p>

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="treatment">
           <br> <p>Try to keep the person calm, comfortable, and still while you examine the injury. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RESET THE BONE! This may cause more damage to the
			bone or surrounding tissue. DO NOT MOVE the person unless you believe non movement will create worse injury. If the dislocation has caused the bone to pierce the
			skin or to result in heavy bleeding, swelling or bruising, you should contact emergency services immediately. Try to control and stop any bleeding that has
			resulted from the dislocation. After calling for emergency services, immobilize the area of the body where the injury took place. Keeping the person still and calm 
			will help prevent further damage to the area as well as keeping them from going into shock. Does it look like the person is in shock? Are they breathing in short
			rapid breaths or do they look like they will pass out? If the injury is not leg based, you can try laying them down and raising their legs. Their feet should be 
			about a foot above their head. Cover them in a blanket. You may want to apply ice packs to the surrounding area to reduce any swelling that might be occurring. 
			Do not apply the cold object directly but instead wrap it in cloth first
			Apply pressure and cover up the injury with either a bandage or clean cloth. Clothing can work as well. Try to sanitize or rinse it very gently.
			ONLY if you have been trained should you attempt to splint the injured limb. </p>
			
			<p>A medical professional will be able to reset the bone back into the joint correctly to ensure that no further damage is caused to the area. Ice can be applied to help control swelling in the area. 
			Should only take a few weeks with proper rest and treatment. Otherwise damage could create persistant pain. If the ligament is weak or dislocations has occurred previously, surgery may be necessary. The area may be weak after healing.</p>
