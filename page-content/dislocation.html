			<br><img src="../media/images/dislocated_finger.jpg" /><br><br>
				<p>Dislocation is when two bones are out of place from the joints that connect them together.
				Dislocations are usually caused by a sudden impact to the joint. This usually occurs following a blow,
				fall, or other trauma. For example, if one falls on their arm, it may dislocate. One can dislocate their
				anckles, knees, shoulders, hips, elbows, jaws, fingers and even their toes.</p>
				
				
				<p>Some people are born with looser ligaments and are more prone to dislocation.
				This is a condition called <strong>Joint Hypermobility Syndrome</strong>. Joints with this condition move
				beyond the range of what is considered normal for them. People with hypermobile joints
				are genetically predisposed to the condition and it is familial. It is suspected that the genes
				that produce collagen are responsible for it. There are also sometimes referred to as being
				"double jointed" or to have "loose joints". Usually this condition has no symptoms
				and needs no treatment but not always. People with symptoms can strengthen their muscles or take medication for pain
				or inflammation.
				</p>
			
				<p>There are some steps to take to <strong>prevent</strong> dislocations. Take proper caution with sports
				and other physical activities. Wear appropriate protection and act responsibly. Also watch areas
				of friction or anything that may make you a fall. This is especially important for adults with children,
				people who enjoy the outdoors, older people with weaker joints or a poorer sense of balance, and anyone who is very active.
				In the house, non skid mats can be used in wet areas like bathrooms. Handrails can be installed to assist
				in staircase use. Avoid using throw rugs.<p>

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="treatment">
           <br> <p>There are a steps to take when <strong>encountering</strong> a dislocated bone. This is an emergency situation. The first thing should be to
		   try to keep the person calm, comfortable,
		   and still while you examine the injury and call emergency services.
		   DO NOT attempt to fix the dislocation! This may cause more damage to the
			bone or surrounding tissue. DO NOT move the person unless you believe non-movement
			will create worse injury. Dislocation can cause the bone to pierce the
			skin or to result in heavy bleeding, swelling or bruising. Try to control and stop any
			bleeding that has resulted from the dislocation. Apply pressure and cover up the injury
			with either a bandage or clean cloth. Clothing can work as well. Try to sanitize or rinse it very gently.
			Apply ice or some other very cold object. Do not apply the cold object directly but instead wrap it in cloth first.
			Apply splint ONLY if you have been trained to do so.
			</p>
			
			<p>Does it look like the person is in <strong>shock</strong>? Are they breathing in short rapid breaths or do they
			look like they will pass out? If the injury is not leg based, you can try laying them down and
			raising their legs. Their feet should be about a foot above their head. Cover them in a blanket. You may want to apply ice packs
			to the surrounding area to reduce any swelling that might be occurring. 
			
			 </p>
			
			<p>A <strong>medical professional </strong>will be able to reset the bone back into the joint correctly to ensure that no further damage is
			caused to the area. Ice can be applied to help control swelling in the area. 
			The dislocation should heal in only a few weeks with proper rest and treatment. Otherwise damage could create persistent pain.
			If the ligament is weak or dislocations has occurred previously, surgery may be necessary. The area may be weak after healing.</p>
			
			<p><strong>After</strong>  being treatedby a medical professional, the person can take pain relievers such as ibuprofen, aspirin,
			naproxen or acetaminophen. Ice packs can relieve pain followed by hot packs that can relax tight and sore muscles. First apply ice for 15-20 minutes
			at a time for a few hours. Then after 2-3 days, apply heating pads or hot packs for 20 minutes at a time. Gentle movements and physical therapy are helpful in healing dislocation because non-movement
			can create stiff joints.
