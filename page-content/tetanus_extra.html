    Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a serious bacterial infection that causes severe and painful muscle contractions.
    These contractions are most common in the neck and jaw areas, hence the name lockjaw. Tetanus can also cause
    stiffness in your abdominal muscles, difficulty swallowing, and body spasms. The spasms can be triggered by trivial
    things, such as light or a loud noise. The spasms can also impair breathing. Getting a tetanus booster shot can help
    to manage the symptoms, or prevent you from getting the infection in the first place. Unfortunately, there is no
    cure, so the infection must run its course. You should get a booster every five years or if you have a deep wound,
    especially if you suspect dirt or animal feces have gotten in the wound. Tetanus is a serious disease and can be
    life-threatening.
