                Commonly known as scrapes, <strong>abrasions are </strong>injuries where the skin is rubbed or torn off. It is likely
                that most people have suffered an abrasion before, likely multiple times. Common abrasions are rug burn,
                and skinning your knee or elbow. Abrasions are not typically deep and usually do not bleed much, if at
                all. However, as with most injuries, abrasions to the face or other blood rich areas are likely to bleed,
                which can be misleading in terms of severity. It is common to receive abrasions more often on bony or
                thinly skinned areas, like the elbows, knees, hands, and shins. Abrasions are typically more painful
                than lacerations or puncture wounds because a much larger surface area is affected.
            </p>
            <p>
                While most abrasions are not deep or serious, <strong>an avulsion </strong>is a serious type of abrasion where the
                affected skin and tissue is actually removed. These are very severe wounds because the affected region
                is torn off, so it is hard to repair the damage. An avulsion should be cared for by a medical
                professional immediately.

                The first step in treatment is to clean the wound as particles can get into the wound easily. However,
                it is likely that the wound is not deep and any particles can usually be removed with ease by washing the wound
                with soap and water. It is not recommended to use alcohol, iodine, peroxide, or other such cleaning
                agents as it could further damage tissue and slow down healing. Next, stop any bleeding by simply applying
                pressure to the wound and by elevating it above the heart. This can be more difficult than for other injuries
                because of the larger surface area of the wound. Finally, apply a bandage to the wound. Applying an ice pack would help
                to lessen any pain.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Infections</strong> are possible with abrasions; pay attention for continuing pain, the wound becoming red and
                swollen, and pus. If bleeding has not ceased after several minutes of applying pressure or a bandage,
                seek medical attention. If the victim has not had a tetanus vaccination in the past five years and the
                wound has been exposed to foreign materials, help should be sought immediately. If someone has suffered
                an avulsion, immediately bring them to the hospital.
