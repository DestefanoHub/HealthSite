                <b>Burns</b> are among the most common household injuries. A Burn is an injury caused by exposure to heat or
                flame. To classify how severe the burn injury is, you need to look at the amount of damage was done to
                the skin and surrounding area. After looking at the ineffected area, the burn then can be classified as
                a <b>1st Degree Burn</b>, a <b>2nd Degree Burn</b>, and a <b>3rd Degree Burn</b>. The more severe the burned
                area is the higher the degree.  1st Degree Burns are classified as a minor burns, whereas 3rd Degree Burns are
                classified as major burns.
            </p>

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade in active" id="causes">
            <p>
                Some of the most common <b>Causes</b> of burn injuries are scalding hot liquids, chemicals, electricity, fire
                (flames from matches, candles, and lighters), excessive sun exposure, and ice or freezers. The cause of
                the burn does not necessarily indicate which burn degree, for example getting burned by scalding liquids
                could cause all three degrees. The <b>Classification</b> of the burn does <b>depends</b> on how <b>long</b>
                the skin made contact with the cause of the burn and how <b>hot</b> it was.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Chemical</b> and <b>Electrical Burns</b> need <b>immediate</b> medical attention no matter what the affected area looks like.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade in active" id="1st_Degree">
            <p>
                A <b>1st Degree Burn</b> causes minimal skin damage or a <b>Superficial Burn</b> because they affect the outermost
                layer of skin. The <b>Signs of 1st Degree Burns</b> are redness, minor inflammation or swelling, and some pain.
                The symptoms will disappear once the skin cells begin to shed, which can be seen when the skin becomes
                dry and begins to peel. A 1st Degree Burn tends to <b>heal</b> within <b>3 to 6 days</b>. 1st Degree Burns usually
                can be treated at homes and do not need professional attention <b>unless</b> the burn area is greater than
                three inches, on the face or a major joint, then you must see a doctor.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three steps to <b>Treat a 1st Degree Burn</b>. The <b>first</b> is to <b>STOP</b> the burn. The
                <b>second</b> is to <b>Cool</b> the burn by soaking the burned area in cool water for five minutes or longer.
                The <b>third</b> step is to <b>Cover</b> the burn by simply covering the area with loose gauze or first
                applying aloe of cream with the gauze. <b>Never</b> ice the area or use cotton balls because it can make
                the burn worse of increase risk of infection. Also do not use home remedies like butter and eggs because they do not work.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade in active" id="2nd_Degree">
            <p>
                A <b>2nd Degree Burns</b> are more serious because the damage to the skin is deeper than the first layer. The <b>Signs
                of 2nd Degree Burns</b> are blisters on the skin, and the skin is extremely red and sore. The area may seem wet
                if one of the blisters have popped. The <b>healing</b> time for a 2nd Degree Burn is about <b>2 to 3 weeks</b> and
                sometimes it takes longer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <b>Treatment for 2nd Degree burns</b> are similar to 1st Degree burns because it follows the same three steps.
                The <b>first</b> is to <b>STOP</b> the burn. The <b>second</b> is to <b>Cool</b> the burn by soaking the
                burned area in cool water for Fifteen minutes or longer. This is different from a 1st degree burn because the burn
                needs to be soaked for a longer period of time. The <b>third</b> step is to <b>Cover</b> the burn by simply covering
                the area with loose gauze or first applying aloe of cream with the gauze. <b>Never</b> ice the area or use
                cotton balls because it can make the burn worse of increase risk of infection.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is very <b>Important</b> for a 2nd Degree burn, to frequently change the bandaging because it prevents infection
                and helps heal the burned area quicker.
            </p>
            <p>
                You must <b>Seek Emergency Medical Treatment</b> if there are 2nd Degree Burns on your face, your hands,
                your buttocks, your groins, and your feet.
