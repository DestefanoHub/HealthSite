                <strong>Burns</strong> are among the most common household injuries. A burn is an injury caused by exposure to heat or
                flame. To classify how severe the burn injury is, you need to look at the amount of damage was done to
                the skin and surrounding area. After looking at the infected area, the burn then can be classified as
                a <strong>1st degree burn</strong>, a <strong>2nd degree burn</strong>, and a <strong>3rd degree burn</strong>. The more severe the burned
                area is the higher the degree. 1st degree burns are classified as minor burns, whereas 3rd degree burns are
                classified as major burns. The classification of the burn does depend on how long
                the skin made contact with the cause of the burn and how hot it was.
            </p>

            <p>
                Some of the most common causes of burn injuries are scalding hot liquids, chemicals, electricity, fire
                (flames from matches, candles, and lighters), excessive sun exposure, and ice or freezers. The cause of
                the burn does not necessarily indicate which burn degree, for example getting burned by scalding liquids
                could cause all three degrees. <strong>Chemical</strong> and <strong>electrical burns</strong> need immediate medical attention
                no matter what the affected area looks like.
            </p>
        
        </div>

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="1st_Degree">
            <p>
                A 1st degree burn causes minimal skin damage or a superficial burn because they affect the outermost
                layer of skin. The signs of 1st degree burns are redness, minor inflammation or swelling, and some pain.
                The symptoms will disappear once the skin cells begin to shed, which can be seen when the skin becomes
                dry and begins to peel. A 1st degree burn tend to heal within 3 to 6 days. 1st degree burns usually
                can be treated at homes and do not need professional attention unless the burn area is greater than
                three inches, on the face or a major joint, then you must see a doctor.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three steps to <strong>treat a 1st degree burn</strong>. The first is to STOP the burn. The
                second is to cool the burn by soaking the burned area in cool water for five minutes or longer.
                The third step is to cover the burn by simply covering the area with loose gauze or first
                applying aloe of cream with the gauze. <strong>Never</strong> ice the area or use cotton balls because it can make
                the burn worse of increase risk of infection. Also do not use home remedies like butter and eggs because they do not work.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="2nd_Degree">
            <p>
                A 2nd degree burn is more serious because the damage to the skin is deeper than the first layer. The signs
                of 2nd degree burns are blisters on the skin, and the skin will be extremely red and sore. The area may seem wet
                if one of the blisters have popped. The healing time for a 2nd degree burn is about 2 to 3 weeks and
                sometimes it takes longer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>treatments for 2nd degree burns</strong> are similar to 1st degree burns because it follows the same three steps.
                The first is to stop the burn. The second is to cool the burn by soaking the
                burned area in cool water for fifteen minutes or longer. This is different from a 1st degree burn because the burn
                needs to be soaked for a longer period of time. The third step is to cover the burn by simply covering
                the area with loose gauze or first applying aloe of cream with the gauze. Never ice the area or use
                cotton balls because it can make the burn worse of increase risk of infection.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is very <strong>important for a 2nd degree burn</strong>, to frequently change the bandaging because it prevents infection
                and helps heal the burned area quicker. You must seek emergency medical treatment if there are 2nd degree burns on your face, your hands,
                your buttocks, your groins, and your feet.

                A 3rd degree burn is the <strong>most dangerous type</strong> of burn a person can get. These type of burn can damage
                the bloodstream, major organs, bones and can lead to a person&rsquo;s death. Though a 3rd degree burn is the
                worst type of burn it does not mean it is the most painful. Most of the times the wounded person feeling
                no pain at all because of nerve damage.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>signs of 3rd degree burns</strong> have a waxy and white, charred dark brown, and raised leathery skin.
