                Lacerations, also typically known as cuts, are rather common injuries. These types of injuries result in
                a separation of the skin at the point of injury. While the terms can be used interchangeably, a
                laceration can describe a more rough and jagged wound, while a cut is usually a more clean and straight
                wound. Most of these injuries are small or shallow and do not cause much bleeding or injury. There are
                certain locations, such as the hands and scalp, that tend to bleed even from a minor cut. Cuts to
                veins or arteries will also bleed more profusely. Deep cuts can be serious injuries. They can end up
                damaging tendons, muscle, and even bone or internal organs. Depending on the severity of the cut, there
                may be some pain at the wound site. This should subside within a day (depending on severity).
            </p>

                A concern with cuts is infection. Because the skin is broken, it is very possible for foreign particles
                to enter the wound. Even just germs or bacteria in the wound could cause an infection. Infections can be
                very serious if not treated, so even a minor wound can become life threatening if infection sets in.
                Infections are much more common in deeper cuts. Some signs of infection are continuing pain, the wound
                becoming red and swollen, and pus.

                Minor cuts are rather common and most people are familiar with how to treat them. The first step in
                treatment is to stop the bleeding. For minor cuts this can easily be accomplished by applying pressure
                to the wound. If the cut is deep or bleeding more vigorously, elevating it above the heart can help to
                slow the bleeding. Unless the cut is very deep or serious, it is not recommended to apply a tourniquet.
                Cleaning the wound is very important. If possible, wash the wound with soap and water to clean out
                foreign particles. Large particles, like glass shards or splinters should be picked out. It is not
                recommended to use alcohol, iodine, peroxide, or other such cleaning agents as it could further damage
                tissue and slow down healing. For small cuts, a bandage and some antibacterial ointment are sufficient.
                If the person is in pain, apply an ice pack. More serious cuts may require stitches. Most cuts will heal
                in a few days by scabbing over.
            </p>
            <p>
                Minor and shallow cuts donâ€™t require medical attention. Deep cuts, especially those where internal
                injuries are suffered, should be brought to the attention of medical authorities immediately. If
                bleeding has not ceased after several minutes of applying pressure or a bandage, seek medical attention.
                If the victim has not had a tetanus vaccination in the past five years and the wound has been exposed to
                foreign materials, help should be sought immediately.
