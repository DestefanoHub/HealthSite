                A <strong>puncture wound</strong> is caused when a sharp or pointed object penetrates the body. These wounds are often
                much deeper than lacerations, even for minor punctures. This is because the object does not cut
                horizontally across the skin, but vertically into the body. Such a wound usually does not bleed too much,
                but can still be very dangerous. There is a much higher risk of infection from a puncture wound because
                the object has penetrated into the body. Common puncture wounds are stingers, bites, and stepping or
                falling on sharp pointed objects like nails or glass.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is likely that <strong>a puncture can leave behind debris in the wound</strong>. If this is the case, there are
                several different courses of action you could take. If the object is still in the wound, you should
                attempt to remove it only if it is not likely to cause damage on the way out. A shard of glass can be
                gently pulled out, but if it is jagged and begins to tear or break off, it should be left. This is
                similar to a splinter, if it is coming out cleanly, then remove it. If it begins to break apart and
                cause pieces to get stuck, leave it. Do not make the wound larger by trying to dig around to remove
                debris. Never remove debris from a puncture wound to the eye. If the wound is serious, either because
                of the location of the wound (such as the eye), or because it has penetrated deeply, do not remove it.
                If the object is removed or falls out, make sure to check if the entirety of the object has come out
                and that none of it is still left in the wound.

                To <strong>treat a puncture wound</strong>, first check if there is anything in the wound, and if safe
                to do so, attempt to remove it.first apply pressure to stop any bleeding. Clean the wound with soap and
                water. Do not use alcohol, iodine, peroxide, or other such cleaning agents, as this can damage tissue
                and slow healing. Apply a bandage over the wound, optionally with antibacterial ointment. If the person
                is in pain, apply an ice pack.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the wound was deep or near a vital area, if bleeding continues for several minutes or is severe, if
                it was caused by a bite (animal or human), or if there is debris still in the wound, <strong>seek medical
                attention immediately</strong>. Infections are much more common with puncture wounds, so constantly check for
                signs of infection, such as pus, redness or swelling, and recurring pain around the wound. If objects
                are still stuck in the wound, they may be visible under the skin.
