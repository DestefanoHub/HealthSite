				<p>Broken bones are also known as fractures in the medical field. The bones are actually cracked, chipped
                or broken. Broken bones can be caused by direct blows to the bone. Repetitive forces can cause stress
                which can break the bone. Broken bones are usually the result of accidents such as those involving
                automobiles, motorcycles and other vehicles. A broken bone can result in heavy bleeding, bruising, or
                swelling of the limb.</p>
						
				<p>
				The elderly are more susceptible to broken bones as well as children. Children have softer bones while
                the elderly have more brittle bones. Children on the other hand are still growing so healing is less of
                an issue. So while an adult can take months to have a bone heal, children can heal in just a few weeks.
				</p>
					
				<p>
				<strong>Prevention</strong> is mainly about common sense. Wear protective gear when playing different
                kinds of sports or any kind of physical activity. Take proper caution, a fall can be all it takes to
                break a bone. Also watch areas of friction or anything that may make you a fall. This is especially
                important for adults with children, people who enjoy the outdoors, older people with weaker joints or a
                poorer sense of balance, and anyone who is very active. In the house, non-slip mats can be used in wet
                areas like bathrooms. Handrails can be installed to assist in staircase use. If you use throw rugs, make
                sure that you use a proper backing to ensure the rugs don't slide around.
				</p>

				<p>
				 If the person experiences any tingling sensations or severe pain, you should contact 911 <strong>immediately</strong>.
                If the break or fracture is suspected to have affected the head, neck, or back, you should call emergency
                services for professional help.

                        If you encounter someone you suspect has a broken bone, try to keep the person calm, comfortable,
                        and still while you examine the injury. <strong>Do not</strong> move the person unless you believe
                        that not moving them will cause more harm. If the break has caused the bone to pierce the skin or to
                        result in heavy bleeding, swelling or bruising, you should contact emergency services immediately.
                        Try to control and stop any bleeding that has resulted from the break. Apply pressure and cover
                        up the injury with either a bandage or clean cloth. You may want to apply ice packs to the
                        surrounding area to reduce any swelling that might be occurring. <strong>Do not</strong> apply the
                        cold object directly but instead wrap it in cloth first. Clothing can work as well. Try to sanitize
                        or rinse the wound very gently. <strong>Only</strong> if you have been trained should you attempt
                        to splint the injured limb. After calling for emergency services, immobilize the area of the body
                        where the injury occurred. Keeping the person still and calm will help prevent further damage to
                        the area as well as keeping them from going into shock. Does it look like the person is in shock?
                        Are they breathing in short rapid breaths or do they look like they will pass out? If the injury
                        is not leg based, you can try laying them down and raising their legs. Their feet should be
                        about a foot above their head. Cover them in a blanket.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even if the break does not appear serious, it <strong>must</strong> still be treated by a medical
                        professional. After immobilizing the wound and ensuring that the person can be moved, take them
                        to a physician.

                There are several ways to <strong>promote healing</strong> if you have a broken bone. You should avoid smoking.
                Certain diets and nutritional supplements such as taking vitamin D and calcium can help. High glucose can
                slow down healing. The area of the fracture must be immobilized. Moving that area will slow healing down
                or worse. Surgeons will provide necessary elements to keep it immobilized, be it a caste, plates, wires, etc.
                It can take several weeks to several months for a broken bone to heal. The pain will usually stop
                much earlier than the time it takes to heal. A doctor will recommend specific exercises to help
                sustain and build muscle strength, flexibility and joint motion.
