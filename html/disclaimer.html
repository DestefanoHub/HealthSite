                    The First Aid Web Kit is designed to provide people with first aid knowledge both in an emergency (through
                    the Immediate Assistance sections) and for more detailed learning (through the Educational sections). The
                    information collected and presented was retrieved through legitimate sources. The developers make no guarantees
                    as to the accuracy of the information. The accuracy of the information is based solely on the accuracy of the
                    sources. The developers are not medical professionals and thus cannot attest to information being presented herein.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the user is ever in an emergency situation, it is the user's responsibility to determine if the situation
                    requires intervention by medical professionals. If such a situation occurs, the first step should be to call
                    911. If the user is not sure whether a situation requires medical professionals, the user should call 911. The
                    Immediate Assistance sections should be used if a situation does not require medical professionals, or to help
                    the injured individual/s after alerting medical professionals but before help arrives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is the responsibility of the user to use his or her judgement when using the information obtained from this site.
